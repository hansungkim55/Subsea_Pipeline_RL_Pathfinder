# Subsea Pipeline RL Pathfinder
This code utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically find safe, easy-to-construct, and cost-effective subsea pipeline routes. The tool considers hazardous zones (cylinders), seabed topography (raster), and On-bottom Stability Utilization (OBSU) constraints. The search is conducted using RL rewards, while the final route selection is based on engineering KPIs.
